A user-friendly team registration website for BallerDreams Community Service, a non-profit organization at my high school. BallerDreams aims to provide opportunities for the underprivileged in Myanmar through sports events. This website streamlines the registration process, making it more convenient for teams to participate in these impactful community service initiatives.
